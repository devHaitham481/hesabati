nodejs design pattern to follow while developing 


* main controller functions like login and signup goes into the controller file. 
* helper controller functions like findUserByUsername...etc goes into helpers folder. 
* controller gets imported into routes folder. No need to import helpers too since helpers are already imported into controllers 
* routes file gets imported into server.js. no need to import controllers or anything else
* models gets imported into controllers 
* models also gets imported into server.js
